# Hawaii elevation contours

I recently went on a trip to Honolulu, Hawaii, and was quite fascinated by some of the paper maps that I saw there. I also saw a [Tableau visualization](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/alexandervar/viz/Hawaii_elevation/HawaiiElevation) by [Alexander Varlamov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-varlamov-8359054a/) and got curious about building elevation contour maps for Hawaiian islands in R! Below you will find the contour maps for the eight Hawaiian islands that make up the state of Hawaii.
